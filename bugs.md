-elapsed time...make it so it starts once begin quiz button is pressed, NOT when tk window opens up
-spaces in num points out of points possible
-fix global variables...having trouble with this
-for 2 attempts on each question: if user gets 1/2 attempts wrong but the 2nd attempt correct, the 2nd attempt carries over to the next question. Not sure how to fix this?
